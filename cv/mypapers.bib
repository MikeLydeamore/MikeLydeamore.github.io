This work outlines an individual-based model (IBM) for the transmission and clinical impact of SARS-CoV-2 that explicitly represents the immunological response to vaccination and infection of each individual. The IBM evaluates waning of immunity to inform risk of infection and related clinical outcomes across a large freely mixing population over time by age and prior exposure status. Modelling immunological responses allows us to investigate the likely impact of immune escape variants based on the landscape in which they emerge. The model described in this paper was motivated by the need to anticipate health and societal impacts of COVID-19 in Australia following emergence of the Omicron variant, in the context of high national vaccine uptake but low infection exposure. It provides a flexible framework for modelling policy-relevant scenarios to inform preparedness and response actions as immunity in a population changes through time.},

Methods: We combined primary health clinic data originally reported in three separate publications stemming from the East Arnhem Healthy Skin Project (Jan-01 to Sep-07). Common statistical techniques were used to explore the prevalence of infectious conditions and the seasonality of infections, and to measure rates of antibiotic use. Results: There was a high monthly prevalence of respiratory (mean: 32\% [95\% confidence interval (CI): 20\%, 34\%]) and skin (mean: 20\% [95\%CI: 19\%, 22\%]) infectious syndromes, with upper respiratory tract infections (mean: 29\% [95\%CI: 27\%, 31\%]) and skin sores (mean: 15\% [95\%CI: 14\%, 17\%]) the most common conditions. Antibiotics were frequently prescribed with 95\% (95\%CI: 91\%, 97\%) of children having received at least one antibiotic prescription by their first birthday, and 47\% having received six antibiotic prescriptions; skin sores being a key driver. Conclusions: Early life infections drive high antibiotic prescribing rates in remote Aboriginal communities. Implications for public health: Eliminating skin disease could reduce antibiotic use by almost 20\% in children under five years of age in this population.},

  abstract = {Background Following widespread exposure to Omicron variants, COVID-19 has transitioned to endemic circulation. Populations now have diverse infection and vaccination histories, resulting in heterogeneous immune landscapes. Careful consideration of vaccination is required through the post-Omicron phase of COVID-19 management to minimise disease burden. We assess the impact and cost-effectiveness of targeted COVID-19 vaccination strategies to support global vaccination recommendations. Methods We integrated immunological, transmission, clinical and cost-effectiveness models, and simulated populations with different characteristics and immune landscapes. We calculated the expected number of infections, hospitalisations and deaths for different vaccine scenarios. Costs (from a healthcare perspective) were estimated for exemplar country income level groupings in the Western Pacific Region. Results are reported as incremental costs and disability-adjusted life years averted compared to no additional vaccination. Parameter and stochastic uncertainty were captured through scenario and sensitivity analysis. Findings Across different population demographics and income levels, we consistently found that annual elder-targeted boosting strategies are most likely to be cost-effective or cost-saving, while paediatric programs are unlikely to be cost-effective. Results remained consistent while accounting for uncertainties in the epidemiological and economic models. Half-yearly boosting may only be cost-effective in higher income settings with older population demographics and higher cost-effectiveness thresholds. Interpretation The seresults demonstrate the value of continued booster vaccinations to protect against severe COVID-19 disease outcomes across high and middle-income settings and show that the biggest health gains relative to vaccine costs are achieved by targeting older age-groups. Funding Funded by the World Health Organization. Research in contextEvidence before this studyEvidence before this study With COVID-19 now globally endemic, populations exhibit varying levels of natural and vaccine-acquired immunity to SARS-CoV-2. With widespread, if variable, immunity resulting in reduced severity of COVID-19 disease, re-evaluation of the ongoing value of vaccination is required. COVID-19 vaccination strategies must consider the cost-effectiveness of gains from vaccination given prior immunity, and in the context of income and health system capacity to manage COVID-19 alongside other pressing concerns.Few articles examine cost-effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination strategies in populations with diverse characteristics and waning hybrid immunity, though there is a large body of literature that considers some combination of these elements or focus on one particular country. Consensus is that allocating vaccine doses to older age groups and those at higher risk of severe disease is most beneficial, albeit assuming either only past natural immunity or no waning immunity. These studies have either not included a cost-effectiveness analysis or, where present, have typically assumed a base case zero-vaccination scenario.Added value of this studyAdded value of this study We consider the contemporary situation where populations have varying degrees of hybrid immunity resulting from both prior infection and vaccination, and where the relevant cost-effectiveness analysis considers only future primary and booster doses in the population. We describe multiple demographics, using exemplar `older' and `younger' populations, in conjunction with low to high past vaccination coverage, low to high past natural infection incidence, and low to high income levels. Under these settings, we determine the cost-effectiveness of a range of targeted boosting strategies (who, when, what).Implications of all the available evidenceImplications of all the available evidence Our study highlights how future COVID-19 booster doses targeted towards older age groups at risk of severe outcomes can be cost-effective or cost-saving in high-income settings with populations that have a higher proportion of individuals at risk. In younger, lower-resourced settings, annual boosting of older age groups may still be cost-effective or cost-saving in some scenarios. We consistently find that pediatric vaccination is not cost-effective. Given the benefits of vaccination, especially to reduce severe disease, we show the importance of ongoing global efforts to provide and equitably distribute vaccines and strengthen adult immunisation programs.},

  abstract = {Infections with Sarcoptes scabiei, or scabies, remain common in many disadvantaged populations. Mass drug administration (MDA) has been used in such settings to achieve a rapid reduction in infection and transmission, with the goal of eliminating the public health burden of scabies. While prevalence has been observed to fall substantially following such an intervention, in some instances resurgence of infection to baseline levels has occurred over several years. To explore the biology underpinning this phenomenon, we have developed a theoretical model of scabies life-cycle and transmission dynamics in a homogeneously mixing population, and simulate the impact of mass drug treatment strategies acting on egg and mite life cycle stages (ovicidal) or mites alone (non-ovicidal). In order to investigate the dynamics of the system, we first define and calculate the optimal interval between treatment doses. We calculate the probability of eradication as a function of the number of optimally-timed successive treatment doses and the number of years over which a program is run. For the non-ovicidal intervention, we first show that at least two optimally-timed doses are required to achieve eradication. We then demonstrate that while more doses over a small number of years provides the highest chance of eradication, a similar outcome can be achieved with fewer doses delivered annually over a longer period of time. For the ovicidal intervention, we find that doses should be delivered as close together as possible. This work provides a platform for further research into optimal treatment strategies which may incorporate heterogeneity of transmission, and the interplay between MDA and enhancement of continuing scabies surveillance and treatment strategies.},

  abstract = {We developed a flexible infectious disease model framework that combines a detailed individual-based model of arrival pathways (quarantine model) and an individual-based model of the arrivals environment (community model) to inform border risk assessments. The work was motivated by Australia's desire to safely increase international arrival volumes, which had been heavily constrained since early 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. These analyses supported decisions on quarantine and border policy in the context of the Australian government's national reopening plan in late 2021. The quarantine model provides a detailed representation of transmission within quarantine and time-varying infectiousness and test sensitivity within individuals, to characterise the likelihood and infectiousness of breaches from quarantine. The community model subsequently captures the impact these infectious individuals have in the presence of varying vaccination coverage, arrival volumes, public health and social measures (PHSMs) and test-trace-isolate-quarantine system effectiveness in the Australian context. Our results showed that high vaccination coverage would be required to safely reopen with support from ongoing PHSMs, and quarantine pathways have minimal impact on infection dynamics in the presence of existing local transmission. The modelling pipeline we present can be flexibly adapted to a range of scenarios and thus provides a useful framework for generating timely risk assessments in the event of future pandemics.},

We sought to describe the hospital admission patterns of patients known to be colonised with carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (CPE), and compare them with CPE-negative patients. Methods We performed a linkage study in Victoria, Australia, including datasets with notifiable diseases (CPE notifications) and hospital admissions (admission dates and diagnostic codes) for the period 2011 to 2020. Where the CPE notification date occurred during a hospital admission for the same patient, we identified this as the `index admission'. We determined the number of distinct health services each patient was admitted to, and time to first admission to a different health service. We compared CPE-positive patients with four cohorts of CPE-negative patients, sampled based on different matching criteria. Results Of 528 unique patients who had CPE detected during a hospital admission, 222 (42\%) were subsequently admitted to a different health service during the study period. Among these patients, CPE diagnosis tended to occur during admission to a metropolitan public hospital (86\%, 190/222), whereas there was a greater number of metropolitan private (23\%, 52/222) and regional public (18\%, 39/222) hospitals for the subsequent admission. Median time to next admission was 4 days (IQR, 0-75 days). Admission patterns for CPE-positive patients was similar to the cohort of CPE-negative patients matched on index admission, time period, and age-adjusted Charlson comorbidity index. Conclusions Movement of CPE-positive patients between health services is not a rare event. While the most common movement is from one public metropolitan health service to another, there is also a trend for movement from metropolitan public hospitals into private and regional hospitals. CPE-positivity does not appear to impact on hospital admission frequency and timing. These findings support the potential utility of a centralised notification and outbreak management system for CPE positive patients.},

We verify the estimation method through a simulation estimation study, and test each dataset to ensure suitability to the estimation method. We find that the force of infection differs by population prevalence, and the infectious period is estimated to be between 12 and 20 days. We also find that optimal sampling interval depends on setting, with an optimal sampling interval between 9 and 11 days in a high prevalence setting, and 21 and 27 days for a lower prevalence setting. These estimates unlock future model-based investigations on the transmission dynamics of skin sores.},

  abstract = {At any one time, more than 160 million children worldwide are infected with skin sores. In remote Aboriginal Australian communities, prevalence is as high as 40\%. Skin sores infected with Group A Streptococcus (GAS) can lead to a number of acute and chronic health conditions. One of the primary risk factors for GAS infection is scabies, a small mite which causes a break in the skin layer, potentially allowing skin sore infection to take hold. This biological connection is reaffirmed by the observation that mass treatment for scabies in these remote communities has been associated with a reduction in the prevalence of skin sore infection, despite skin sores not being directly targeted. In the most extreme case, it has been hypothesised that the eradication of scabies in remote communities may lead to an eradication of skin sore related infection. Mass drug administration is the go-to solution for tackling the high prevalence of disease in these rural settings, but despite more than 20 years of implementation, sustained reductions in prevalence have not been achieved.    My aim in this thesis is to develop and analyse both mechanistic and statistical models of skin sores and scabies, considering the dynamics of each disease in isolation and coupled together. These models build a framework on which control strategies can be tested, with the aim to develop strategies that will lead to sustained prevalence reductions.    Following a biological introduction and technical information (Chapters 1 and 2), a mechanistic model for scabies infection is introduced. This model includes the dynamics of the life-cycle of the scabies mite, incorporating two methods of treatment for the infection. Mass drug administration strategies are also modelled. The optimal interval between successive mass drug administration (MDA) doses is calculated to be approximately two weeks. The analysis shows that an optimally timed two-dose, 100\% effective, 100\% coverage MDA is highly unlikely to lead to the eradication of scabies. In fact, four optimally timed successive doses are required for a probability of eradication greater than 1/1000. Next, an annually recurring MDA program is considered, in which some number of optimally timed doses is administered, and repeated annually. It is shown that increasing the number of administered doses always increases the probability of eradication. Importantly, moving from a two dose to a three dose annual strategy significantly increases the probability of eradication of scabies infection.    In order to parameterise a dynamic transmission model for skin sores, at least two key quantities must be estimated: the force of infection, and the infectious period. The study in Chapter 4 estimates the age of first infection, which is the inverse of the force of infection, using clinic presentation data of children from birth up to five years age. Three survival models are considered: the Kaplan-Meier estimator, the Cox proportional hazards model, and the parametric exponential mixture model. The mean age of first infection is estimated to be ten months for skin sores, and nine months for scabies. The work in Chapter 5 estimates both the force of infection and the infectious period by utilising a linearised infectious disease model. The data considered in this chapter consists of longitudinal observations of individuals across three studies. The methodology is verified using simulation estimation, and each dataset tested to ensure it carries sufficient information for use with the estimation method. The estimates for the force of infection vary by an order of magnitude between settings. Estimates of the infectious period are relatively constant at 12 - 20 days.    Chapter 6 consists of a dynamic model for skin sores transmission coupled with models for scabies transmission. Three different scabies models are considered. The first assumes that the dynamics of scabies are at equilibrium. In this case, analytical expressions for key epidemiological quantities can be derived, and values for the scabies prevalence below which skin sores will be eradicated can be calculated. Next, two dynamic models of scabies are considered. The first of these is the scabies model introduced in Chapter 3, which includes the full life-cycle of the scabies mite and treatment mechanisms. The second model consists of just three compartments, which is termed the SITS model. The SITS model approximates the complex life-cycle of the scabies mite into two compartments. The differences in dynamics between these two scabies models are analysed, and the impact on the prevalence of skin sores of an MDA which directly targets only scabies is considered. The comparison shows that, relative to the full model, the SITS model overestimates the impact on skin sores prevalence due to the MDA in the time period immediately following the MDA, but also predicts an earlier time of return to pre-MDA endemic infection prevalence. The SITS model also estimates a higher probability of eradication of skin sores compared to the full model. These two results demonstrate that caution should be taken when approximating the life-cycle of the scabies mite to consider the potential impact of MDA which targets only scabies.    Finally, Chapter 7 summarises the work presented in my thesis, discusses the limitations of the work and explores potential future directions for this research problem.},

While this allows clinicians more open access to these data, a trust has to be placed with the investigators releasing these data without the availability of scientifically rigorous peer review. The examples of results from trials studying dexamethasone and hydroxychloroquine for treatment of COVID-19 have had contrasting outcomes, including the potential for significant numbers of lives saved with the early release of results from the RECOVERY trial studying dexamethasone contrasting with unsubstantiated data being presented from trials studying hydroxychloroquine. Clinicians and researchers must maintain a healthy scepticism when reviewing results prior to peer-reviewed publication, but also consider when these opportunities may allow for early implementation of potentially lifesaving interventions for people infected with COVID-19.},

  abstract = {Background: Australian states and territories used test--trace--isolate--quarantine (TTIQ) systems extensively in their response to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020-2021. We report on an analysis of Australian case data to estimate the impact of test--trace--isolate--quarantine systems on SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Methods: Our analysis uses a novel mathematical modelling framework and detailed surveillance data on COVID-19 cases including dates of infection and dates of isolation. First, we directly translate an empirical distribution of times from infection to isolation into reductions in potential for onward transmission during periods of relatively low caseloads (tens to hundreds of reported cases per day). We then apply a simulation approach, validated against case data, to assess the impact of case-initiated contact tracing on transmission during a period of relatively higher caseloads and system stress (up to thousands of cases per day). Results: We estimate that under relatively low caseloads in the state of New South Wales (tens of cases per day), TTIQ contributed to a 54\% reduction in transmission. Under higher caseloads in the state of Victoria (hundreds of cases per day), TTIQ contributed to a 42\% reduction in transmission. Our results also suggest that case-initiated contact tracing can support timely quarantine in times of system stress (thousands of cases per day). Conclusion: Contact tracing systems for COVID-19 in Australia were highly effective and adaptable in supporting the national suppression strategy from 2020--21, prior to the emergence of the Omicron variant in November 2021. TTIQ systems were critical to the maintenance of the strong suppression strategy and were more effective when caseloads were (relatively) low.},

We calibrated a detailed compartmental model of Victoria's second wave to multiple geographically-structured epidemic time-series indicators. We achieved a good fit overall and for individual health services through a combination of time-varying processes, including case detection, population mobility, school closures, physical distancing and face covering usage. Estimates of the risk of death in those aged {$\geq$}75 and of hospitalisation were higher than international estimates, reflecting concentration of cases in high-risk settings. We estimated significant effects for each of the calibrated time-varying processes, with estimates for the individual-level effect of physical distancing of 37.4\% (95\%CrI 7.2-56.4\%) and of face coverings of 45.9\% (95\%CrI 32.9-55.6\%). That the multi-faceted interventions led to the dramatic reversal in the epidemic trajectory is supported by our results, with face coverings likely particularly important.},

  abstract = {Households are an important location for the transmission of communicable diseases. Social contact between household members is typically more frequent, of greater intensity, and is more likely to involve people of different age groups than contact occurring in the general community. Understanding household structure in different populations is therefore fundamental to explaining patterns of disease transmission in these populations. Indigenous populations in Australia tend to live in larger households than non-Indigenous populations, but limited data are available on the structure of these households, and how they differ between remote and urban communities. We have developed a novel approach to the collection of household structure data, suitable for use in a variety of contexts, which provides a detailed view of age, gender, and room occupancy patterns in remote and urban Australian Indigenous households. Here we report analysis of data collected using this tool, which quantifies the extent of crowding in Indigenous households, particularly in remote areas. We use these data to generate matrices of age-specific contact rates, as used by mathematical models of infectious disease transmission. To demonstrate the impact of household structure, we use a mathematical model to simulate an influenza-like illness in different populations. Our simulations suggest that outbreaks in remote populations are likely to spread more rapidly and to a greater extent than outbreaks in non-Indigenous populations.},

Because infection may be spread by people who are pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic, substantial undetected transmission is likely to occur before clinical cases are diagnosed. Thus, when outbreaks occur there is a need to anticipate which populations and locations are at heightened risk of exposure. In this work, we evaluate the utility of aggregate human mobility data for estimating the geographical distribution of transmission risk. We present a simple procedure for producing spatial transmission risk assessments from near-real-time population mobility data. We validate our estimates against three well-documented COVID-19 outbreaks in Australia. Two of these were well-defined transmission clusters and one was a community transmission scenario. Our results indicate that mobility data can be a good predictor of geographical patterns of exposure risk from transmission centres, particularly in outbreaks involving workplaces or other environments associated with habitual travel patterns. For community transmission scenarios, our results demonstrate that mobility data add the most value to risk predictions when case counts are low and spatially clustered. Our method could assist health systems in the allocation of testing resources, and potentially guide the implementation of geographically targeted restrictions on movement and social interaction.},
