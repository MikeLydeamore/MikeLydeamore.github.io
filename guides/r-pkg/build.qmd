title: "Build, Check, and Install"

Now that your package has:

- A function
- Some documentation
- (Maybe) some data

â€¦ it's time to **build**, **check**, and **install** it!

These are standard steps for developing R packages, and `{devtools}` makes them easy.

---

## Step 1: Document Everything

Before building, make sure all documentation and the `NAMESPACE` are up to date:

```r
devtools::document()
```

This will:

- Generate help files (`man/*.Rd`)
- Update the `NAMESPACE` file
- Warn you if any roxygen is incomplete

---

## Step 2: Run Package Checks

```r
devtools::check()
```

This simulates what CRAN does before accepting a package.

It checks:

- Missing documentation
- Broken examples
- Syntax errors
- Suggested packages
- Licensing and metadata

::: callout-tip
A package that passes `check()` is ready to share or install.

## Step 3: Install Locally

Once `check()` is clean:

```r
devtools::install()
```

This compiles your package and installs it into your system R library.

Then, you can use it like any other package:

```r
library(mypackage)
```

---

## Step 4: Try It Out

Check that everything works from a clean session:

1. Restart R (Session > Restart R)
2. Load your package:

```r
library(mypackage)
```

3. Try your function and data:

```r
add_numbers(4, 5)
my_dataset
```

4. Try help pages:

```r
?add_numbers
?my_dataset
```

---

## Optional: Share via GitHub

If your package is version-controlled with Git, and you have a GitHub account, you can publish it:

```r
usethis::use_github()
```

This will:

- Create a GitHub repo
- Push your code
- Set the remote for future commits

Then others can install it directly:

```r
devtools::install_github("yourname/mypackage")
```

> ðŸ“¢ **No CRAN required.**

---

## Bonus: Build a README

Use this to generate a `README.Rmd` with example usage:

```r
usethis::use_readme_rmd()
```

Then knit it. This gives users a friendly intro when they land on your GitHub repo.

## Common Gotchas

| Problem                          | Fix                            |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Function not found after install | Did you run `@export` and `document()`? |
| Help page missing                | Roxygen missing or malformed   |
| `check()` fails with notes       | Read the messages carefully â€” not all notes are fatal |
| Function works in dev, not after install | Try restarting R and loading the installed version |

## Whatâ€™s Next?

Congrats! Youâ€™ve built and installed a working R package.

Next steps:

- Add tests with `usethis::use_testthat()`
- Set up continuous integration (CI)
- Consider submitting to CRAN (optional!)
- Keep improving and versioning your work
