🎉 You've created, documented, built, and installed your first R package!

Whether you're building internal tools, publishing reusable code, or documenting datasets for analysis, you now have a powerful foundation.

Here are some ideas for continuing your package development journey:

### Add Tests

Use `{testthat}` to write tests for your functions:

```r
usethis::use_testthat()
usethis::use_test("add_numbers")
```

Tests help you:

- Catch bugs early
- Document edge cases
- Build confidence before sharing

---

### Add Continuous Integration

Automate package checks and tests on GitHub with GitHub Actions:

```r
usethis::use_github_action_check_standard()
```

This gives you automatic feedback every time you push a commit.

---

### Share Your Work

- Create a GitHub repo with `usethis::use_github()`
- Add a `README.Rmd`
- Include example usage and badges
- Tag releases with version numbers

If it’s useful to others, make it public!

---

### Submit to CRAN (Optional!)

If you want to publish on CRAN:

- Carefully follow [R Packages 2e](https://r-pkgs.org/release.html)
- Tidy up your `DESCRIPTION`
- Make sure `check()` has **0 errors, 0 warnings, 0 notes**
- Submit via [https://cran.r-project.org/submit.html](https://cran.r-project.org/submit.html)

Not required — many useful packages live on GitHub forever.
