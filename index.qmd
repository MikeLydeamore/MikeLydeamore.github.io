::: {#hero-heading}

I am a lecturer in Business Analytics and Data Science in the [Department of Econometrics and Business Statistics](https://www.monash.edu/business/econometrics-and-business-statistics) at Monash University. I also hold honorary appointments with [Alfred Health](https://www.alfredhealth.org.au/) and [SaferCare Victoria](https://www.safercare.vic.gov.au/).

I love working on translational and high-impact projects across any industry. If you have a question or a project that you think needs a data-driven approach, please **get in touch** with the details below.

My **research interests** are:

* Health analytics,
* Healthcare acquired infections,
* Understanding data collection methods in the healthcare setting,
* Infectious diseases control,
* Statistical software development and workflow.

:::

I am an advocate of re-use of historical datasets, and performing analysis in as open of a way as possible while preserving privacy of those whom data has been collected. I have an active GitHub profile which contains most of my research code that can be made publicly available.

I thoroughly enjoy engagement with societies and research centres. I am currently the Treasurer of the Australia and New Zealand Industrial and Applied Mathematics (ANZIAM) society, ECA Chair for the NHRMC Centre of Research Excellence [SPECTRUM](https://www.spectrum.edu.au/), and in a non-academic context, treasurer of the [North Park Tennis Club](https://play.tennis.com.au/NorthParkTennisClub).
