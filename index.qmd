::: {#hero-heading}

I am a lecturer in Business Analytics and Data Science in the [Department of Econometrics and Business Statistics](https://www.monash.edu/business/econometrics-and-business-statistics) at Monash University. I also hold honorary appointments with [Alfred Health](https://www.alfredhealth.org.au/) and [SaferCare Victoria](https://www.safercare.vic.gov.au/).

I am a broadly skilled statistician and infectious disease modeller whose work spans a wide array of applications across health, biostatistics, and various non-medical fields. From simple regressions to advanced machine learning and large-scale mathematical modelling, my versatile skill set equips me to tackle complex questions in public health, policy, and beyond.

Building on my extensive background in infectious disease modelling, my current projects involve studying COVID-19 dynamics and controlling the spread of antimicrobial resistance in Victorian hospitals, in collaboration with The Alfred and the School of Clinical Sciences (Monash University). I also explore broader topics outside health, including quantitative approaches to policy-making, data analytics in the social sciences, and machine learning solutions for diverse challenges.

My research sits at the intersection of robust statistical tools and real-world data. Whether applying basic regressions or advanced machine learning techniques, I consistently bridge theoretical foundations with hands-on solutions. This interdisciplinary approach underpins my commitment to generating impactful, evidence-based insights that guide clinical practice, policy decisions, and innovation in fields far beyond epidemiology.

:::

I am an advocate of re-use of historical datasets, and performing analysis in as open of a way as possible while preserving privacy of those whom data has been collected. I have an active GitHub profile which contains most of my research code that can be made publicly available.

I thoroughly enjoy engagement with societies and research centres. I am currently the Treasurer of the Australia and New Zealand Industrial and Applied Mathematics (ANZIAM) society, ECA Chair for the NHRMC Centre of Research Excellence [SPECTRUM](https://www.spectrum.edu.au/), and in a non-academic context, treasurer of the [North Park Tennis Club](https://play.tennis.com.au/NorthParkTennisClub).

I am open to consulting opportunities across a wide range of fields, offering a versatile skill set that combines fundamental statistical techniques with advanced methods such as machine learning and mathematical modelling. Whether you need straightforward statistical analyses or more complex predictive approaches, I am available to collaborate on data-driven projects that inform decision-making in public health, policy, business, or other sectors.
