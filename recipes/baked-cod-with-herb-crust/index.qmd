# Baked cod with herb crust

Very nice but can dry out the fish.

## Ingredients

* 3 tbsp vegetable oil
* 125g breadcrumbs
* 1 lime
* 4 tbsp parsley
* 2 tbsp chives
* 1 tsp Dijon mustard
* 1 tbsp ginger
* Papper
* 4 fillets firm white fish


## Method

Mix together breadcrumbs, lime zest, chopped parsley and chives, mustard, ginger, oil and seasoning. Place the cod fillets onto a lined baking tray and sprinkle with lime juice. Divide the topping among the fillets, pressing firmly into the fish. 

Bake for 20 minutes at 200C.
