# Bircher Oats

Very nice to eat but also a pain to make.

## Ingredients

* 25g oats
* 1 tbsp dried fruit
* 6 tbsp apple juice
* Berries
* Splash of milk
* Handful of almonds
* Spoon of yoghurt


## Method

Soak oats and dried fruit in apple juice overnight. Add the rest of the ingredients in the morning and hope your coffee has kicked in.
