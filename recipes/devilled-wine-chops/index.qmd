# Devilled Wine Chops

Mum used to make this for me. It's very easy to do, just need a big oven dish really.

## Ingredients

* 6 lamb chops
* 1 clove garlic
* 1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce
* 1 tbsp lemon juice
* 3 tbsp red wine
* 1 tsp celery salt
* 1 onion
* 2 tsp mustard powder
* 1 tin tomato soup


## Method

Place chops into a greased casserole dish. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Bake at 180&deg;C for 45 minutes.

Remove from oven and pour off fat.

Chop onion and crush garlic. Combine with remaining ingredients in a saucepan. Bring to the boil. Pour over chops and bake for a further 45 minutes at 180&deg;C.
