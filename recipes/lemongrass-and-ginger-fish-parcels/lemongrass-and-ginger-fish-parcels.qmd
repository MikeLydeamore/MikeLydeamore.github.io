# Lemongrass and Ginger Fish Parcels

Sounds weird, but does work. But make sure the fish is good.

## Ingredients

* 2 lemongrass stalks
* 2 cloves garlic
* 5cm piece of ginger
* 2 tsp seasame oil
* 1/4 cup soy sauce
* 1 red capsicum
* 600g firm white fish
* 4 spring onions


## Method

Finely chop lemongrass, combine with crushed garlic, grated ginger, sesame oil and soy sauce in a dish. Season. Add fish and turn to coat. Finely slice capsicum and divide spring onions into 4 portions that will fit in the parcel.

Cut 4 x 20cm pieces of baking paper

Place 1/4 of the fish on a sheet of paper. Top with 1/4 of the onion and capcisum. Spoon over a little of the sauce. Fold over the baking paper and tie with kitchen string. Place on a baking tray, and repeat for remaining 3 parcels.

Bake for 15 to 20 minutes at 200C
