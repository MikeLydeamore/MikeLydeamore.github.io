# Macaroons

The french classic.

## Ingredients

* 100g almond meal
* 180g icing sugar
* 100g egg whites
* 1/4 tsp cream of tartar
* 35g castor sugar

## Method

Separate egg whites 24h before - store in a lightly covered bowl. 

Beat egg whites and cream of tartar on medium speed until foamy. Add castor sugar. Beat until stiff peaks. In three additions, sift the ground almonds and sugar into the meringue. Fold the mixture until it is of lava consistency. Pipe onto trays and tap to remove air bubbles. 

Leave to sit for 30m. Bake at 16 degrees for 15m.

The macaroon should lift freely from the parchment. Fill with cream of choice.
