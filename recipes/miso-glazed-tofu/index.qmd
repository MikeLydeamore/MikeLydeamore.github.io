# Miso Glazed Tofu

Miso paste on Tofu. Ez.

## Ingredients

* 1 packet high protein tofu (or extra firm)
* 3 tablespoon soy sauce or tamari (1 for the sauce and 2 for the tofu marinade)
* 2 tablespoon miso paste (can vary, see above)
* 3 tablespoon maple syrup
* 1 tablespoon sesame seed oil
* Â½ tablespoon garlic, minced
* 5 grams nutritional yeast
* 1 teaspoon garlic powder
* 3 tablespoon cornstarch (1 tbsp to coat tofu)
* 120 ml water or more to taste

## Method

Dice tofu into 1-inch cubes. Marinade for 30 minutes in 2 tbsp soy sauce/tamari

After 30 minutes, add nutritional yeast, corn starch, and garlic powder. Use a small spatula to toss it until it is evenly coated.

Bake at 190C for 12 minutes, toss and continue to bake for another 8-10 minutes until desired crispiness is achieved.

Next, whisk the miso paste into the &frac12; cup of water along with the cornstarch, soy sauce, and maple syrup.

Set a pan on medium heat and add sesame oil. Once hot, add garlic and fry for 30-45 seconds. 

Add the sauce ingredients, stir consistently, and let simmer for 3-4 minutes until it thickens.

Check the consistency of the sauce and add more water if desired. The sauce should be thick and viscous but still a bit runny.

At this point, tofu should be done cooking. If tofu has met your desired level of crispiness, add it to the pan and toss it into the sauce.

Serve over rice and vegetables, enjoy!
