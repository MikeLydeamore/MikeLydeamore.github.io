# Pickle Soup

Sounds weird but is strangely tasty

## Ingredients

* 1 osso bucco
* 2 potatoes
* 1 cup pearl barley
* 6 pickles + some juice
* 2 tbsp tomato paste
* 1 carrot
* 1 onion
* 1 clove garlic


## Method

Boil osso bucco in water to make meat broth. Add 1 cup of pre-soaked pearl barley. Add chopped potatoes, pickles and juice, and 2 tbsp of tomato paste. Chop carrot, onion and garlic and fry until lightly browned, then add to the soup. Boil until it's ready.
