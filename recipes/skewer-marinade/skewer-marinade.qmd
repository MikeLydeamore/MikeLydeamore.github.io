# Skewer Marinade

Good for the BBQ, although they do shrink a bit.

## Ingredients

* 1 cup vegetable oil
* 1/4 cup dijon mustard
* 3/4 cup soy sauce
* 1 1/2 tsp pepper
* 1/2 cup lemon juice
* 2 cloves garlic
* 500g diced beef
* 2 onions
* 2 capcisums
* 1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce

## Method

Mix all ingredients except beef, onion and capsicum in bowl and mix. Add meat, cover and marinate for 4 to 24 hours.

Add alternating pieces of onion, capsicum and meat on a pre-soaked skewer. Pan fry or BBQ.
