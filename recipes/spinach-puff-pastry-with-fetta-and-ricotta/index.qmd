# Spinach puff pastry with Fetta and Ricotta

Good to burn up some extra pastry.

## Ingredients

* 4 sheets puff pastry
* 2 1/2 cups frozen spinach
* 1/2 onion
* 2 cloves garlic
* 1 tbsp olive oil
* 1 cup ricotta
* 1 cup fetta (crumbled)
* sesame seeds (undisclosed amount)
* 1 egg


## Method

Fry chopped onion and garlic until soft and translucent. Add frozen spinach and cook until no liquid remains. Leave to cool. 

Combine with feta and ricotta. Cut each sheet of pastry intro 3 strips. Spread mixture between strips and fold over to make a roll. Brush with egg wash. Cut holes to vent steam. Add sesame seeds to top.
