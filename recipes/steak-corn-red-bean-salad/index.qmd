# Steak, Corn and Red Bean Salad

## Ingredients

- 500g piece lean beef sirloin steak, trimmed of excess fat
- 1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce
- 2 tsp ground cumin
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 1 cup frozen corn kernels
- 800g canned red kidney beans, rinsed, drained
- 1 lemon, juiced
- 2 spring onions, sliced on the diagonal

## Directions

Place the steak in a bowl and sprinkle over the Worcestershire sauce and 1 teaspoon of the ground cumin. Toss to coat the steak in the mixture.

Heat the olive oil in a frypan over medium-high heat. When the pan is hot, add the steak and cook for about 5 minutes each side for medium, or until cooked to your liking. Remove from the heat and set the steak aside in a warm place for a few minutes to rest, then slice.

Meanwhile, blanch the corn kernels in a pan of boiling water. Combine the drained kidney beans and corn in a bowl. Add the lemon juice and the remaining teaspoon of ground cumin to the bean mixture and toss to combine.

Add the sliced steak and the sliced spring onion to the salad and toss gently to combine.
