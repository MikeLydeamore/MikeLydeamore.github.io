# Stuffed Capsicum

Another good one. Don't take the capcisums out of the pan when they've finished cooking, let them cool down.

## Ingredients

* 8 capsicums (less if they won't fit in your pot)
* 500g beef mince
* 200g rice
* 150g tomato paste
* 200g carrots
* 200g onions
* salt
* pepper
* vegetable oil
* sour cream



## Method

Grate carrots and finely chop onion. Fry in pan in oil. Mix mince and boiled rice in a bowl. Add half of the carrot and onion mix, season with salt and pepper. Cool, and stuff inside hollowed capsicums. 

Put other half of carrot and onion mix into a pot. Add tomato paste, add capsicums. Add water to 2/3 of capsicum height. Cover and boil for 45 minutes. 

Serve with sour cream.
